<!-- ABOUT THE REPOSITORY -->
## About the repository

This repository is a collection of projects I have conducted in my spare time. This portfolio aims to give a brief overview on my capabilities as a Data analytics specialist.
I have tried to use a multitude of different languages and tools in different projects.

Some competencies displayed here are:
* Creating queries to get specific data (Temp tables, CTE, Views)
* Using R for data import, cleaning, exploration, and analysis
* R Markdown for documentation on analysis process
* Tableau for creating interactive dashboards

In the following a short introduction to each project is shown, with regards to the programming languages and tools used.
For detailed implementation, feel free to look inside the folders!

<!-- COVID PROJECT -->
## COVID Project

This project uses a data set on worldwide COVID-19 numbers. Especially, infections, deaths, and vaccinations are listed. In the project, the data is inspected, by comparing infection rates in regions, death rates and the correlation to vaccinations.
After exploring the data, a dashboard is created using Tableau to provide a general overview and a tool for the user to interactively explore the data set.
The data is derived from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and is pre cleaned and ready to use.

For the data exploration SQL has been used with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Tableau was used to create the dashboard. The data is represented by csv files.

There is not a separate documentation of the steps taken, however each query is commented with thourough explanation.

<!-- CYCLISTIC PROJECT -->
## Cyclistic Project

The cyclistic project is a capstone project suggested in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. 
In this project I take data from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html, and perform 5 data analytics steps:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Act

A thorough documentations on each step is provided in https://github.com/7oelchoi/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Cyclistic/Cyclistic_documentation.html.

Here the language R is used with RStudio and Markdown for the documentation. Visualizations are created by using the ggplot2 package. Tidyverse and multiple other packages are used too.

<!-- HOUSING PROJECT -->
## Housing Project

This project inspects a data set on housing sales. Here, I used SQL to clean the data using various methods. 

I used SQL and the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to perform the cleaning steps.
Here are some of the cleaning steps performed:

* Removing unnecessary information from columns
* Splitting columns into multiple different ones
* Populateing NULL values
* Removing inconsistencies
* Removing duplicate entries

A more detailed description on the data cleaning process is shown in https://github.com/7oelchoi/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Housing/Documentation.pdf. The documentation was done using LaTeX.
